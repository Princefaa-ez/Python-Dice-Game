# Python Dice Game
Objective is to build a python file running a dice game.

The aim of the game is to build an animal using select body parts.
The choice of animal is between a Pegasus and Unicorn.

See how long it takes to build the chosen animal in accordance with the game specifications.
The end goal is to compare which animal is quicker to build and how many dice rolls it takes.

There will be additions to the file as I go about improving on it, so any suggestions are most welcome!!
